In the last week or two I’ve had first-hand contact with many folks who have gotten Covid, more than in the last few years combined, and here’s what I know as a witness.

*   You can get Covid twice (again) — 18–24 months apart
*   You can get Covid unvaccinated — we knew this
*   You can get Covid “fully vaccinated” — we suspected this
*   You can get Covid “fully vaccinated” + booster — still a bummer
*   You can get Covid working in public — obviously
*   You can get Covid nearly completely isolated (i.e. a few trips to the store and that’s it) — really thought we could hide from it

I am not a doctor, this should not be confused with medical advice, and is 100% opinion — but I will include my reasons/evidence and gladly hear other alternatives.

You can’t hide from Covid. I used to think we could “burn it out” and isolate it and if we tracked it close enough, and enough people caught it and got natural immunity, and enough others got vaccinated and had that immunity, that eventually we’d starve out Covid and it wouldn’t find a place to “breed” and spread. But if people can get it multiple times and vaccinated people can get it, then the traditional understanding of “herd immunity” doesn’t really seem to work with Covid. Vaccines alone haven’t worked, some countries with very high vaccination rates have also had high spikes in infection ([Increases in COVID-19 are unrelated to levels of vaccination across 68 countries and 2947 counties in the United States (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8481107/) ). This has caused countries to give up on eliminating the virus ([New Zealand admits it can no longer get rid of coronavirus (apnews.com)](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-health-new-zealand-auckland-829fc4cd04e68e9e3b264ac03418aeaf) ). This is not anti-vaccine, quite the opposite, they are still recommending/requiring the vaccine to minimize the symptoms of people when they do get it, and minimize the time people are sick with it.

**The Vaccine**

*   From my first-hand experiences (very limited scientific sample, but real to me) will limit (possibly significantly limit) the severity and symptoms of Covid when you eventually catch it. It will shorten the time you have these symptoms.

> Personal Note: Did my arm swell up like a balloon and hurt for almost a week after the second dose of Moderna and temperature go all up-and-down, yes, are there real vaccine risks, yes. But I can, again personally, say that the risks of the Covid virus, and long-term effects of the virus, appear significantly greater than the risks and impacts of the vaccine. We won’t know the long-term impacts of either for years, but for now my first-hand evidence points towards vaccines being the lesser risk. IMHO.

**Get a Test**

*   Call/see a doctor or try to get into a Pharmacy test site
*   Get tested ASAP, the sooner you know, the sooner you can start treatments that can help lessen the symptoms and impact. The longer you wait, the deeper Covid can get and the harder it can be to do something about.

> Personal Note:When I was in the hospital with a family member, I was asked to “witness” the signing of two DPOAs when other Covid patients were being moved to ICU and possibly unable to respond to questions about ongoing treatment and interventions (witness needed to be a non-family, non-hospital person apparently, and there aren’t a lot of those around in a Covid ward). You don’t want to be one of these people, or the people who are signing up to make decisions for these people.

### Stop the Covid

*   Cough drops/syrup — stop the unproductive cough
*   Tylenol — aches, headaches, fever
*   With a positive test and doctors guidance, may get
*   Monoclonal antibodies — amp up your immune system
*   Remdesivir — inhibits viral replication
*   Steroids —reduce inflammation, and strengthening the body to help breathe, fight — there is additional information online about how steroids can also help suppress the immune system early on to keep the body from hurting itself, which makes their use complex (again, consult your doctor, obviously).
*   Anti-clotting agent — one of the biggest long-term issues with Covid is that it can cause clots and embolisms in the body.
*   Other, based on your particular symptoms and health history

### Clear the lungs / breathe

*   Mucinex (loosens fluid)
*   Lay on your stomach (“prone”) — it really helps your lungs open up, and having someone tap your back (like in the “olden days”) still works amazingly well.
*   Get a chest x-ray to see the extent
*   With a doctors guidance, may also get
*   Inhaler/nebulizer (docs recommendation)
*   Oxygen (if necessary)
*   Lasix (reduces fluid)
*   “Acapella” device — weird, but works
*   Other, based on your particular symptoms and health history

### Recover

*   Rest
*   Get fully recovered
*   Possibly tested again depending on your situation.
*   Follow the quarantine guidelines and those of your work or organizations

### What Can You Do Before You Catch Covid?

*   Plan to get Covid — sad but true
*   Be ready to isolate and self-quarantine, get tested, and have enough supplies to get you through.
*   Some basic medicine cabinet supplies like a thermometer, **fingertip pulse oximeter**, tylenol, cough suppressant, mucinex, tissues, chicken soup.

> Note: The Pulse Oximeter was key for us in that it identified one family member who’s oxygen was lower than it should be, which lead to an immediate response. This is not a common pre-covid thing to have on-hand, so it worth looking into.

*   Network/friends/community — support each other, even from a distance, meals, essentials, porch pickup, support, mow/shovel, etc.
*   Know what symptoms and severity you should consider a test, and have a plan/place to get the test.
*   Know what symptoms and severity you should consider to go to the Emergency Room, and have a plan for where to go.
*   Share your plans with those around you, and be ready to support each other’s plans.
