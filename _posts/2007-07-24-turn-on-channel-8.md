*This could end up being a really great site – Microsoft has been really going after the student developer and releasing a lot of good tools (e.g. Express versions, Code4Fun) – Bruce*

Microsoft just opened in new web site/community site for student technology enthusiasts called [Channel 8](https://news.microsoft.com/2008/02/18/microsoft-gives-students-access-to-technical-software-at-no-charge-to-inspire-success-and-make-a-difference/).

> Channel 8 is THE place to be for STUDENTS who want to code, connect and create technology. Stay plugged into tech news and share in the experience with students around the world just like you who want to see their creations come to life. This is also a back door directly into Microsoft just like [Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/) but from a student point of view. This means access to the inside scoop about our products and life working inside Microsoft and information on cool things coming out. This is your community – a place for you to share your tips and tricks and even your problems. Go check out what others are doing and talk about what you think is cool.

It's new and content is just starting to roll out but it looks like it is going to be quite the place.
