(2) Full-time managers - attending meetings all day, having 1:1s, zero coding time. [The slow death of the hands-on engineering manager - And how to combat it.

## Summary

This weeks link include: The world of Artificial Intelligence continues to navigate its dual nature—both as a tool of immense utility and a potential source of ethical quandaries. Ethan Mollick's exploration into when to employ the advantages of AI, and when to rely on our human intuition, speaks to an age-old conundrum of wisdom: the judicious discernment between embrace and restraint. Meanwhile, as developers embark on their December-coded adventures, they're reminded of the joy in diversity and collaboration, as seen in ventures like the C# Advent, where developers learn through a communal spirit that harnesses both their unique paths and shared goals.

Simultaneously, the landscape of leadership and innovation is reshaping under the influences of storytelling and evolution in managerial roles. JD Meier's contemplation on leadership as an act of world-building transcends the mundane, inviting leaders to craft new realities through narrative. In contrast, Anton Zaides laments the gradual fading of hands-on engineering managers, spotlighting the tug-of-war between engagement in code and administrative duties. As we gaze upon the simplicity and elegance of a visual proof in mathematics or the nostalgic digital archeology of historical tech rivalries, like Palm and Apple's exchanges, we are reminded of the wonder in simplicity, the thrill of discovery, and the profound impact of design and foresight in this ever-expanding universe of knowledge.

## Short Summary

Innovation flourishes as AI poses ethical questions. Thought leaders like Mollick and Meier explore balance and world-building, fostering collaboration.
