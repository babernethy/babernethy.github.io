*Sure it is a really neat example of modern development and user interface, but it is also a really nice program. I tried it out for 20 minutes or so and had my entire extended family in (as much as I could remember). Laura got a hold of it and filled in some major data back to the 1700s. Now if it would just to the research for you. – Bruce*

*Family.Show is a genealogy program that demonstrates the usage of WPF for a complex, realistic scenario. If you're a fledgling WPF developer who wants to pore over some code that demonstrates best practices for application construction, there's nothing better out there today.*

If you've not yet tried out Family.Show, you can run it from here: http://www.vertigo.com/downloads/familyshow/familyshow.application (now dead link)
