 An interesting perspective - a big part of the "joy of programming" is the puzzle/problem solving aspect.  If AI can "help" with this, is it taking away that aspect of the work, or assisting with it - sometimes both.

 Under measures unveiled on Tuesday, ads showing "less healthy" food and drinks will only be allowed to be aired after the 9:00 pm watershed from October next year. The government hopes the new measures could help prevent some 20,000 cases of childhood obesity a year.

#AI #development #eink #fun #jobs #thinking 

This week's roundup of interesting links: from the evolution of programming to the festive spirit of caroling. An intriguing debate around AI's impact on programming explores whether tools that assist in solving coding puzzles enhance or diminish the joy of programming. Complementing this, a list of utilities like ExamDiffPro and GitDiffMargin offers practical tools for developers to streamline their workflows.

On the eink front, the Amazon Kindle Scribe 2 shines with its smooth reading and writing experience, bolstered by a redesigned Premium Pen - but pricey. Meanwhile, a nostalgic look at the GW-BASIC User’s Guide reminds us of the roots of computing. In education, the "Hour of Code" initiative continues to inspire young minds to embrace coding, though questions around corporate influence remain. 

Rounding out the week, a classic interview with **Calvin & Hobbes' Bill Watterson** sparks reflections on creativity, while a poignant article on burnout reminds us of the importance of self-care. In public health, the UK’s decision to ban daytime ads for unhealthy foods aims to tackle childhood obesity.
