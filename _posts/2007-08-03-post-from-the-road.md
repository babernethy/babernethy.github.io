I just want to see if I can actually do a blog post using [Jott](https://geekestateblog.com/jott-the-new-way-of-texting-emailing-and-blogging/), let's see if this works.

**UPDATE:** The above was sent via cell phone, transcribed and e-mailed by Jott.com, then post-processed by a quick program I wrote (code soon) and posted automatically to the blog. Which means I can speak a blog post at any time from anywhere. Wild. Now I just need to figure out how/why this would be useful.

**UPDATE (2024):** Jott.com is now an online clothing store - so some links removed, but the article and experience remain.
