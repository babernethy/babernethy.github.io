## New bird visitor - the Junco

I saw the "Dark-eyed Junco" move up to #1 on my "bird listener," and I had never heard of this guy.  Turns out the Junco spends the spring until fall in the Canadian Arctic and then migrates "south" to Michigan among other places. 

## Check the birdseed mix

So I made sure the birdseed mix we've got out supports them - but they like more of the "cheaper" mix like millet.  We've had primarily a "woodpecker, titmouse, chicadee, cardinal, blue jay" which is sunflower seeds, some nuts, and a little dried fruit.
Many of the rest of my "Top 10" eat bugs ... I tried live mealworms for the Eastern Bluebirds we had this year, and that failed miserably - and I think it would be worse in the cold and freezing weather.  So no plans for "help" for those birds this winter - any ideas?

In the end it's cool to know what birds are in my woods to help plan and make these decisions.
