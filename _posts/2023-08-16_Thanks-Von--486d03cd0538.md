Thanks Von. And no, I would not argue that proximity is "indispensable" for building a team, or even in creating the friction/polishing talked about here. But I would argue that it may be a catalyst or optimize the effect - but this could be for good or bad. Note Jobs specifically talks about good teams and high-functioning people. Optimizing interactions and friction among toxic or dysfunctional people would have a very negative effect. I also know that many good products (e.g. OSS projects) can get done with large remote teams, but I'm willing to posit that if these good teams were working closely together, they might be able to polish things off and do even more amazing things together.
